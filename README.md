  "primaryDescriptionBody": "Welcome to the page that's all about me! ;) I've been wanting to build myself a web page for a while. But...between school, work, looking for jobs, and marriage, it has been tough. This page will be a living project for me. I will update it frequently as my skills improve. Currently, the website is built with a simple frontend of HTML and CSS and a web service delivering information about me through Express.js and MongoDb. Even this description is somewhere in the database floating around. Well that's enough of an intro. Feel free to look around the website. And if you are an employer who got my resume, feel free to hire me :D",
  "aboutMeDescription": "As you've probably gathered, my name is Josh. I was born and raised in the Bahamas. I love the island life. Sun, sand, and sea. Not to mention the food. I developed a passion for technology very young. I've always been the computer guy. But, I didn't really find my passion until I spent a lot of time(and money) in University. I bounced around between Computer Engineering and Computer Science until I discovered the Software Engineering degree. As soon as I took the first few classes, I realized that software and web development was my future. In a few short months, I will be graduating with a B.S in Software Engineering and hopefully doing what I love for a job: working with others, solving problems, and coding. While in college, I met the love of my life and we were married on April 9th, 2021. My wife has been a rock and foundation for me in my life. Working together, we have expanded our vision of what is possible for us and a future family. We are building together.",
  "internship": {
    "orgName": "Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints",
    "position": "Web Development Intern",
    "startDate": "January 2023",
    "endDate": "April 2023",
    "description": "Working as a Web Development Intern with the LDS church on a team for the comeuntochrist.org website, I was able to work alongside some of the brightest and most creative developers in the industry. From day one, I was thrown into the repository and made to work on projects that would increase my knowledge of the domain. Being a part of the team meant that I reviewed code and pull requests from other team members and took on stories that ranged from simple variable changes, to bug fixes, to full component overhauls. In my time there, I was able to see several of the stories I worked on tested and deployed to the live website."

    "currentPosition": "Assistant Operations Supervisor",

    "description": "Currently, I work as the Ast. Ops. Supervisor for the IT Support Center at my university. I work alongside the Ops. Supervisor and Support Center Manager to organize and give trainings, lead meetings, and manage the operations team's day-to-day. I've worked in this position for several months before my internship and have returned to it afterwards. I have worked for the IT Support Center for over 2 years now and have had opportunities to grow in Leadership, Teamwork, and Communication ability. However, this is not my only work experience. I have been working since the age of 12. From packing grocery bags, retail work, cleaning hotels, carpet cleaning, bathroom cleaning, I have done it all. All of my work experience has taught me to value and respect every member of an organization no matter their position. It takes each individual doing their best at their role for a business to succeed."
